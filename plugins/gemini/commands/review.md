Run a Gemini code review through the plugin runtime.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return Gemini's output verbatim to the user.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run in a Claude background task.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - Also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files as reviewable work even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the review is clearly tiny.
  - In every other case, recommend background.
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.

Background flow:
- Launch the review with `Bash` in the background:
```typescript
Bash({
  command: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"`,
  description: "Gemini review",
  run_in_background: true
})
```
- Do not call `BashOutput` or wait for completion in this turn.
- After launching the command, tell the user: "Gemini review started in the background. Check `/gemini:status` for progress."
